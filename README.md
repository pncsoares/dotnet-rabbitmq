# RabbitMQ in Dotnet Core

This is a Demo project using RabbitMQ in Dotnet Core console application, for learning purposes 🎓

In this Demo we will use a queue for message communication between a producer application and a consumer application.

One of the concepts when using microservices is the communication between microservices and having a decoupled communication using something like a message queue. And RabbitMQ fits right in there.

RabbitMQ is a message broker so lets see first what a message broker is.

# What is a message broker?

You can think of a message broker like a post office. Its main responsibility is to broker messages between publisher and subscribers.

Once a message is received by a message broker from a producer, it routes the message to a subscriber.

- **Producer** is an application responsible for sending messages
- **Consumer** is an application listening for messages
- **Queue** is where the messages are stored by the broker (is the storage)

Message broker pattern is one of the most useful patterns when it comes to decoupling microservices.

# RabbitMQ

Is an open source message broker and it is probably one of the most widely used message broker out there.

[📄 Official RabbitMQ documentation](https://www.rabbitmq.com/documentation.html)

## 👍 Advantages

- Extremely lightweight and very easy to deploy
- Supports multiple protocols
- It has a management interface
- Highly available and scalable

## 👎 Disadvantages

- Not reliable for large data sets
- Non-transactional by default

## Protocols

As we can see in the Pros, RabbitMQ supports a bunch of them but the main protocol, out of the box is the AMQP 0-9-1.

AMQP 0-9-1 is a binary messaging protocol specification. This is the core protocol specification implemented in RabbitMQ. All other protocol support is through plug-ins.

### Other protocols supported

- **STOMP** - text based message protocol
- **MQTT** - binary protocol focusing mainly on Publish/Subscribe scenarios
- **AMQP 1.0** - it is a newer version than the AMQP 0-9-1 but it is completely different, much more complex and, according to the documentation, it is not supported by most of the clients
- **HTTP and WebSocket**

# Setup

## How to install RabbitMQ

We will use [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/) to install an image of RabbitMQ.

> Download docker using [this link](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if you don't have it installed

Now that we have docker installed, we just need to open the terminal and execute the following commands:

```bash
# list all the images installed
docker images
```

```bash
# install docker and start the container
docker run -d --hostname my-rabbit --name demo-rabbit -p 15672:15672 -p 5672:5672 rabbitmq:3-management

# docker run = Run a command in a new container
# -d = Run container in background and print container ID
# --hostname my-rabbit = Sets the host name
# --name demo-rabbit = Sets the name of the instance
# -p 15672:15672 = Sets the port used by the management console
# -p 5672:5672 = Sets the port used for AMQP 0-9-1 protocol
# rabbitmq:3-management = The image that we will going to use
```

> Now if you run the `docker images` again command, you will see the RabbitMQ image installed

```bash
# fetch the logs of a container
docker logs -f {container ID}

# example: docker logs -f c7f05085d9e93f49ea1fd59d227896adc676cadd20fee00db3993bdba2e36348

# you can also input just the 3 first characters of the container ID and docker will figure it out for you 👇
# example: docker logs -f c7f
```

> If you restart your computer or just want to run the container again without installing the image, you just need to do the following:
>
> ```bash
> docker ps -a
>
> # docker ps = List containers
> # -a = Show all containers (default shows just running)
> ```
>
> Identify the container that we created in the second step and copy the container ID
>
> ```bash
> docker start -ai {container ID}
>
> # docker start = Start one or more stopped containers
> # -a = Attach STDOUT/STDERR and forward signals
> # -i = Attach container's STDIN
>
> # example: docker start -ai c7f
> ```
>
> Now, the container is up and running

Open a browser with the following URL: http://localhost:15672

You will see something like this:

![RabbitMQ Login page](./.github/images/rabbitmq-login-page.png)

> The default username and password are: `guest`

You can now run the Consumer console application and then run the Producer console application and see the message displayed in the Consumer's console.

To do that, you can use your IDE buttons/options or via terminal, executing the following command:

> before executing the command, `cd` to this repository root directory

```bash
# consumer
dotnet run --project .\Consumer\Consumer.csproj

# producer
dotnet run --project .\Producer\Producer.csproj
```

Example of a message:

```
{"Name":"Producer","Message":"Hello World!"}
```

Take a look at RabbitMQ interface (http://localhost:15672) to see the message being produced to the queue and then consumed:
